Software Development Approaches

Waterfall

Waterfall
Sequential Phases: Each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
Documentation: Emphasis is placed on documentation at each stage. 
Planning and Design: Extensive planning and complete design are done at the beginning. 
Testing: Testing is a separate phase and occurs after the build phase. 
Changes and Revisions: Difficult and costly, as it usually requires revisiting and revising earlier stages.
Project Completion: The product is delivered in its entirety after the final phase. 

Agile
8

Agile
Iterative and Incremental: Iterative approach where the project is divided into small increments known as 'sprints'.
Continuous Collaboration: Continuous collaboration with the customer and cross-functional teams. 
Adaptive Planning: Rapid and flexible response to change.
Testing: Testing is continuous and occurs simultaneously with development.
Customer Feedback: Regular feedback from the end-user is encouraged.
Product Releases: The most important features are developed first resulting in multiple releases.


Wagile
Combination of the two
Can start Agile for Requirements and design before going to Waterfall for Implementation and Testing
Could start Waterfall and move to Agile.
Choice depends on the type of project, skills of team, focus on skills, knowledge etc.

Waterfall Project Scenarios
Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements, a clear scope, and minimal expected changes.
Scenario 1: Government Compliance System
A government agency needs a system for tax filing that must comply with strict legal regulations.
Requirements are fully defined upfront, and changes would require formal approval.
Security and compliance audits must be conducted before deployment.
Scenario 2: Construction Project Management Software
A construction company requires software for tracking materials and worker schedules.
The design must be completed before implementation since construction processes are rigid.
Changes after development would be costly and time-consuming.
Scenario 3: Embedded Systems for a Medical Device
A company is developing firmware for a pacemaker, which must meet medical industry standards.
Regulatory approval requires detailed documentation and rigorous testing.

Agile Project Scenarios
Agile works well for projects with evolving requirements, iterative development, and continuous feedback.
Scenario 1: E-Commerce Website for a Startup
A startup is launching an online store but is unsure about customer preferences.
Features such as payment gateways, recommendation systems, and chat support can be adjusted based on feedback.
Continuous iteration allows quick adaptation to changing market trends.
Scenario 2: AI-Powered Chatbot for Customer Support
A company wants to integrate a chatbot but isnâ€™t sure about user queries and behaviors.
Agile allows them to start with a basic chatbot and improve it based on user interactions.
Machine learning models can be iteratively trained with real-time data.
Scenario 3: Mobile Game Development
A game studio is developing a new mobile game and wants to test different mechanics.
Agile sprints help developers release prototypes, gather user feedback, and iterate gameplay elements.

Wagile Project Scenarios
Wagile is suited for projects that require upfront planning but also need flexibility for incremental improvements.
Scenario 1: Banking Application Modernization
A bank wants to update its legacy banking system while ensuring regulatory compliance.
Waterfall is used for core banking functions that must remain stable.
Agile is used for customer-facing features like a mobile app and personalized recommendations.
Scenario 3: Smart City IoT Deployment
A city is deploying a smart infrastructure with traffic sensors and energy management.
Waterfall is used for foundational components like network setup and security protocols.
Agile teams work on real-time data dashboards, predictive analytics, and citizen applications.
